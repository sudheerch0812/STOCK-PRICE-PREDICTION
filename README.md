# STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION
In recent years, the financial markets have witnessed significant volatility, making accurate stock price
prediction a critical challenge for investors and financial analysts. Traditional methods of stock
forecasting, including statistical approaches and linear models, often fall short in capturing the
complexities and non-linear relationships inherent in financial time series data. As a result, there is a
growing interest in leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.
This project aims to address the problem of stock price prediction, specifically focusing on the NIFTY
50 stock index, which represents a diversified basket of 50 major stocks listed on the National Stock
Exchange of India. Given the index's importance in reflecting the economic health of India, accurate
forecasting models are essential for informed investment decisions.
